Computer Vision: Choose Best Architecture for Image Classification
In this project, different deep learning architectures were tested for image classification. The goal was to select the best model based on performance metrics.

Key Achievements:
Completed training (train_one_epoch) and evaluation (evaluate) functions.
Tested 4 architectures (excluding Inception) and selected the best model.
Provided a complete training pipeline with comments and model analysis.
Technologies Used:
Python, PyTorch (or TensorFlow), Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab.
