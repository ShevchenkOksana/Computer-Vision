Computer Vision: Semantic Segmentation
This project focuses on training models for semantic segmentation. The task involved experimenting with different architectures, tuning hyperparameters, and selecting the best model for segmenting images into meaningful categories.

Key Achievements:
Implemented training (train_one_epoch) and evaluation (evaluate) functions for semantic segmentation tasks.
Tested 4 different architectures for segmentation.
Tuned optimizer and learning rate scheduler to accelerate model convergence and improve performance.
Selected the best-performing model based on segmentation accuracy and evaluation metrics.
The notebook includes a complete training pipeline with comments and highlights the best model.
Technologies Used:
Python, PyTorch (or TensorFlow), Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab.
